# Voltera

## Introduction
Voltera is a powerful project running on its on operating system called "VolteraOS"; and reserved for an AI-powered body armor kit with a voice access AI assistant that we developed to streamline your experience. It utilizes various modules such as `asyncio`,  `subprocess`, `os`, `time`, `datetime`, `pyautogui`, `socket`, `boto3`, `pydub`, `psutil`, `cv2`, `google`, `imaplib`, `gpiozero`, `json`, `io`, `win32com.client`, `PIL`, `speech_recognition`, `EdgeGPT`, `openai`, `whisper`, `requests` and many more that help you to enhance your productivity and efficiency.

## Utilization
To use Voltera, please follow the user manual found at the path [admin\manual.pdf](admin\manual.pdf)

## Features and Modules

### Asynchronous Programming with asyncio
Voltera leverages the `asyncio` module to enable concurrent programming, making it easier to write highly efficient and responsive code. You can take advantage of its coroutine-based syntax to perform concurrent I/O operations, handle multiple network connections, and more.

### Subprocess Management with subprocess
With the `subprocess` module integration, Voltera enables you to execute external commands and manage subprocesses from within your code. You can spawn new processes, interact with their input and output streams, and even capture their output for further processing.

### Operating System Interaction with os
Voltera incorporates the `os` module to provide seamless interaction with the underlying operating system. You can perform file and directory operations, access environment variables, execute system commands, and more, all from within your code.

### Time and Date Manipulation with time and datetime
The `time` and `datetime` modules integrated into Voltera empower you to work with time-related operations effectively. You can manipulate dates and times, calculate time intervals, format timestamps, and perform various time-based calculations effortlessly.

### Network Communication with socket
Voltera incorporates the `socket` module to enable network communication in your code. You can create network sockets, establish connections, send and receive data over TCP/IP or UDP, and build networked applications.

### Visualizing Environments with Pillow, IMAP, BytesIO and Google Cloud
Voltera uses the `PIL`, `imaplib`, `io` and `google.cloud` modules to visualize and detect all nearby objects and identify them in your daily situations without interruptions or disturbtions.

### Voice Recognition for Ease of Access
Modules `pydub`, `boto3`, `speech_recognition`, `whisper`, `ffmpeg`, `av` and `playsound` help in using voice access to commit and use commands for more efficiency.

### AI and Voice Assistant
The AI thinks and uses prompts from both Bing AI and ChatGPT through the modules `EdgeGPT` and `openai` for more knowledge and access to the web's data through Bing's search engine.

### Agility with GPIO Functions
The project uses the module `gpiozero` to move motors, light and unlight light sources, operate buttons and more for better personalization and speed during tasks.

### Socialization and Communication
Voltera communicates with other devices using the modules `email`, `google` and `tkinter` to send messages and create phone calls.



## Installation and Usage
To use Voltera, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10.10 installed on your system.
2. Install the required modules by running the following command but make sure you are in the directory of Python 3.10.10 (C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/Scripts/) if you have multiple versions of Python running on your machine:
